      <p>Let's start with what an eigenspace is. An eigenspace is a subspace
      of a vector space that is invariant under the action of a matrix. Now,
      any vector in this eigenspace is an eigenvector. Since the eigenspace
      is invariant, it must be stretched by some factor &lambda; &mdash; this
      is the eigenvalue. Because of linearity, the eigenvalue is well-defined;
      that is, it is the same for all eigenvectors in a particular eigenspace.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>At the left you see &#x211D;<sup>2</sup>. You can click on any point
      of the plane to place a vector there; this vector will be drawn, together
      with its image under some secret matrix. The goal is to find the eigenspaces
      of this matrix; if you know where it is, simply click there. A short note:
      getting the first eigenvalue is easy; it's the second that is hard.</p>
      <p>Also, very rarely, you'll get a matrix without eigenvalues. Sorry! Just
      click &ldquo;Reset&rdquo; under the plane. Happy eigening!</p>
      <h2>Credits</h2>
      <p>Programmed by Pavel Panchekha. Inspired by the Matlab demo,
      &ldquo;Eigenvalue Game&rdquo;. And finally, many thanks to the WhatWG for
      &lt;canvas&gt; and the rest of HTML5.</p>
